# holy-donuts-app-be

This is the Java, Springboot, PostgreSQL backend to the 'Holy Donuts' web application. Before running the application, you will need Docker and then to run the docker-compose file to create a container for the database. Run this repository with the holy-donuts-app-fe repo to get the whole application working in local. The front end can be found at https://github.com/PMT13/holy-donuts-app-fe
